//this program takes a distance from the user then performs the appropriate calculations 
//to display how many earth days it needs the project-s spaceship to reach this distance.

//we import Scanner to use it for user inputs

		//Algorithm 2: Simple Travel-Time Computer
		//we ask the user to input the desired distance in km and we declare it as a double to take any amount the user wants
		System.out.print("\nPlease enter the distance (in km) between the Earth and the extraterrestrial body: ");

		final double SPEED_IN_MPH = 28000;
		final double SPEED_IN_KMPH = SPEED_IN_MPH * CONVERSION_RATE_MPH_TO_KMPH;
		
		//calculation that takes the input of the distance divided by the speed of the spaceship in kmph, divided by 24 hours to convert to earth days
		double days = (distance/SPEED_IN_KMPH)/24;
		
		//we add 0.5 to days, then cast it as an integer to round it. 
		//if decimal in original answer is .5 or above, it would be rounded, if its less than .5, it wont be rounded
